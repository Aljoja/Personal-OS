YOU:
What did we talk about yesterday

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CLAUDE:
Looking through my memory, I don't have any recorded conversations from yesterday (January 15th, 2025). 

The most recent conversations I have stored are from January 16th (today), where you asked me to list our conversations and what we talked about today.

It's possible we didn't chat yesterday, or those conversations weren't saved to my long-term memory. Would you like to tell me about anything important from yesterday that I should remember?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

YOU:
Show me all the conversations we've had so far

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CLAUDE:
Based on my memory, here are all the conversations I have recorded:

## January 16th, 2025 (Today)

**Conversation 1:**
- **You:** "List all the conversations we have had today"
- **Me:** Listed that single conversation (which was just starting)

**Conversation 2:**
- **You:** "Give me a list of the messages I have sent you today"
- **Me:** Listed your messages from that day including:
  - "Hello this is a test"
  - "What did we talked about today?"
  - "What did we talk about today"
  - "Give me a list of the messages..."

**Current Session (also January 16th):**
- **You:** "What do you know about me"
- **Me:** Shared your profile information
- **You:** "What did we talk about yesterday"
- **Me:** Explained I don't have records from yesterday
- **You:** "Show me all the conversations we've had so far"
- **Me:** (this current response)

---

That's everything I have stored! It seems we've had a fairly brief history together so far. The information I have about you (your job at Gurit, goals, etc.) was likely added to my memory earlier, but I don't have the full conversation history of when you shared all those details.

Is there anything from past conversations you'd like me to know or remember?
